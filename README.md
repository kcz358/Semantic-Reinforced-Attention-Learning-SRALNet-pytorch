# Semantic-Reinforced-Attention-Learning-SRALNet-pytorch
Pytorch implementation on SRALNet from [Semantic Reinforced Attention Learning for Visual Place Recognition(]https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08443)

The SRALNet, similar to the [NetVLAD](NetVLAD: CNN architecture for weakly supervised place recognition) also use a unified conv layer to process the extracted local features. Differently, the SRALNet does an extra intra cluster assignment to suppress irrelevant object.
